### Key Insights from User (Mathieu)
1. **Voice-First Interface Priority**
   - Users are tired of typing
   - Voice interaction is more natural
   - Typing creates physical strain

2. **Multimodal Interaction Vision**
   - Natural conversation flow
   - Camera-based document scanning
   - Real-time validation
   - Military alphabet for accuracy
   - Example flow:
     ```
     AI: "Hey, do you have your driver's license?"
     User: "Yes"
     AI: "Great, hold it up to the camera... 1,2,3... perfect!"
     AI: "Does this look correct?"
     User: "No"
     AI: "What's not correct?"
     User: [explains]
     AI: "Can you spell your name in military alphabet?"
     ```

3. **Document Management Features**
   - Real-time form downloads
   - PDF population
   - Document management module
   - Deadline tracking
   - Compliance checking
   - Calendar integration

4. **Process Automation**
   - Automatic form population
   - Real-time validation
   - Photo scan verification
   - Document storage and management

5. **User-Centric Priority**
   - User experience comes first
   - Attorney onboarding is secondary
   - Focus on reducing friction
   - Natural interaction flow

### Action Items
1. Implement Gemini Flash 2.0 multimodal integration
